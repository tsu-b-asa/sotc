On matters of status effects, I encoutered a repeated and consistent and persistent and terminal and malignant and EVIL fucking problem in
which my status effects would repeat proc every time the character sheet was modified, so they would just keep stacking their modification to
the derived values on the sheet without end and made me want to kill myself.

As such, statuses are currently done entirely cosmetically, with the exception of triggerable status effects that instantaneously modify a value

Additionally, please note that this system was developed using a template, namely "Simple Worldbuilding System" made by Atropos
I, Tsubasa, did not fully understand everything that came with this system. I have thusly not touched several things as listed below:
constants.js
helper.js
macro.js
templates.js
token.js

Most of the language references have also been removed by my own desire for expediency in the creation of this version
Ideally the system will eventually be adapted for more languages, but the good thing is that the sheets *are* currently largely done with iconography

Also I don't know what the gulpfile.js does, so I didn't touch it
